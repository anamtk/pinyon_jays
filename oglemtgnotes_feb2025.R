# Model convergence checks: 
#- are the presence checklists clustered in space/covariate values? or
## are they variable in covariate values? 
#- check priors - do they mesh with data?
#- are presence records geographically distributed narrowly? Could 
## I run a model with only those areas and use that as initials?
#- lambda should be multiplied by the area of the blob
#- look at samples of a0 and c0. Are they identifiable or 
## highly correlated?
#- check distribution of covariates. 
#- fix c0 at a reasonable value of ~3% presence and see if it helps
#- is there a good dataset of "known" true number of jays?



#Changing model suggestions
#- monsoon variability as a covariate?
#- add other interactions?
#- add in canopy variables for detection?
